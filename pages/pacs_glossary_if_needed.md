**Note:** [NIST SP-800-116, Revision 1, _Guidelines for the Use of PIV Credentials in Facility Access_, "Appendix G: Terminology"](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-116r1.pdf){:target="_blank"} contains PACS-related terms and definitions.

| :----------- | :-------------------------------     | <br>
| **Access Control** | The process of granting or denying specific requests to: 1) obtain and use information and related information processing services; and 2) enter physical facilities (e.g., federal buildings, military establishments, and border crossing entrances) [NIST SP 800-116, Revision 1].                         |
| **Access Point** | **Add definition**                |
| **Authentication**  | The process of establishing confidence of authenticity; in this case, in the validity of a personâ€™s identity...authentication often means the performance of a PIV authentication mechanism [NIST SP-800-116, Revision 1]. Verifies that the credential (PIV or Common Access Card [CAC]) and the controls on it are authentic and valid.|
| **Authoritative Sources** | These sources can be (for example) Windows Active Directory, PIV card database, personnel security system, or other identity management systems IDMS. These systems are connected to automatically update an Enterprise PACS Management System (or *Cardholder Provisioning System*) as new identities are created and all terminated identities are removed. |   
| **Audit**   | Compliance with federal and agency policy must be measured and monitored and violations or gaps addressed and mitigated.  Enterprise PACS solutions centralize management and visibility of all PACS controls within an agency.| 
| **Authorization**  |  Grants access  to only the resources a person needs to perform a job.  A person with an authentic, high-assurance credential (PIV or CAC) will not have access to all resources.  In a large enterprise with thousands of employees and contractors needing access to hundreds of different access points, attempting to manage authorization manually is costly, time consuming, and error-prone.|
| **Credential** | A collection of information about a person, attested to by an issuing authority. A credential is a data object (e.g., a certificate) that can be used to authenticate the cardholder. One or more data object credentials may be stored on the same physical memory device (e.g., a PIV card) [NIST SP-800-116, Revision 1].    |
| **Provisioning** | Specifying for each identity both the credential used (ex. PIV, CAC, or PIV-I card) and the privileges granted to access specific resources, such as a particular facility, door, or access point, and ensuring that complex set of rules is enforced.|
| **Verification System** | Examples of verification functions are PIN validation, card expiration check, and biometric validation. |
