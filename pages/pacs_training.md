Training is a critical component of all FIPS 201-compliant Enterprise Physical Access Control System (E-PACS) implementations. This page outlines E-PACS personnel roles and responsibilities, and lists relevant training and certification programs. 

## Technical Roles and Responsibilities

E-PACS project teams consist of both agency employees and contractors. Teams should include Technicians, Operators, Engineers, and Architects to deploy and maintain an E-PACS. Teams may include support from specialists in project management, system administration, physical security, facility management, acquisitions, budget, law, etc.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------| 
| Technicians | Responsible for the installation, administration, and maintenance of system components. |
| Operators | Responsible for using the system to perform physical security functions such as providing access privileges to credentials and responding to system generated events and alarms.|
| Engineers | Responsible for making configuration recommendations and advise on system-wide improvements, optimization, testing, and deployment or maintenance efforts.|
| Architects | Have extensive experience and are responsible for providing technical direction for problem definition, analysis, requirements development, design and implementation of solution delivery|

## Recommended Training

Training recommendations align with the different responsibilities for each role. 

| Role | Recommended Training |
|------|-------------| 
| Technicians | Should complete the [GSA Approved Products List (APL)](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"} PACS product manufacturer certification training for the solution being implemented.| 
| Operators | Should complete tailored training that reflects agency policies and procedures, their role within the agency, and the facility’s specific PACS configuration. Tailored training can be provided by Authorized Service Providers and/or by the agency. Operators can complete the [GSA APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"} PACS product manufacturer certification training for the solution being implemented.|
|Engineers| Hold a current [Certified System Engineer ICAM PACS (CSEIP) certification](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"}. This certification program provides the necessary training and a minimum assurance of ability to efficiently and effectively implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Identity and Credential Access Management (ICAM) architectures for PACS. Engineers can complete the [GSA APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/) PACS product manufacturer certification training for the solution being implemented.|
|Architects| Should have familiarity with the specific [GSA APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/) PACS manufacturer solution being implemented and agency specific policy and procedure to make design recommendations. Architects should also have completed the [CSEIP certification](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"} to implement Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication mechanisms. Additionally, globally recognized, vendor-neutral, information technology certifications provide Architects with added knowledge and experience related to environmental considerations that may impact the E-PACS.|

## Training Opportunities

{% include alert-info.html content="Agency employees should consider these training opportunities when submitting their annual training plan and using their annual training budget." %}

### Equipment Manufacturers
[GSA APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"} PACS manufacturers offer product-specific Operator and Technician courses through authorized service providers resulting in a manufacturer’s certification.

>**Note:** Manufacturer training may not address unique operational procedures or facility-specific configurations, so authorized service providers on [GSA Schedule 84](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/list-of-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement){:target="_blank"}, and/or [GSA Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70){:target="_blank"} could conduct this training. 

### Authorized Service Providers
Authorized service providers, found on [GSA Schedule 84](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/list-of-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement){:target="_blank"}, and/or [GSA Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70){:target="_blank"}, offer manufacturer training for the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the E-PACS. This training can be tailored to your agency and facility, focusing on the features that have been implemented and how the system is configured to complement agency operational policies and procedures. This should be determined during the procurements phase (For detailed information, see [Procurements]({{site.baseurl}}/procure/){:target="_blank"}).

### Industry Certifications
Industry certifications are vendor neutral and standards-based training offerings that relate to E-PACS processes and functions. Available certifications include, but are not limited to:

-	The **Secure Technology Alliance (STA)** offers three relevant certification programs:
    1.	The [CSEIP program](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"} trains those responsible for implementing mandates set by OMB M-05-24 and OMB M-06-18. GSA requires that all work performed on approved E-PACS for GSA managed facilities are installed by CSEIP professional.
    2.	The [Certified Smart Card Industry Professional (CSCIP) program](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-leap-cscip/){:target="_blank"} trains those needing to know smart card technology fundamentals, security considerations, application and data management, and usage models.
    3.	The [Certified Smart Card Industry Professional/Government (CSCIP/G) program](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-leap-cscip/){:target="_blank"} trains those needing to know FIPS 201, PIV Card and Federal identity management initiatives.
-	**ASIS International** offers two relevant certification programs:
    1.	The [Certified Protection Professional (CPP) program](https://www.asisonline.org/certification/certified-protection-professional-cpp/){:target="_blank"}, for those who manage security programs.
    2.	The [Physical Security Professional (PSP) program](https://www.asisonline.org/certification/physical-security-professional/psp-exam-domains-and-knowledge-statements/){:target="_blank"}, for those who design and implement physical protection systems.
-	The **Security Industry Association (SIA)** offers the [Certified Security Project Manager (CSPM) program](https://www.securityindustry.org/professional-development/cspm-certification/){:target="_blank"} for those who manage complex technical security projects. 

### GSA PACS Reverse Industry Training (2018)
