Should be knowledgeable about Federal Government and agency-specific policies, standards, and guidance documents to make designer recommendations related to an E-PACS/PACS implementation. Architects must possess a current [CSEIP certification](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"} or other similar, federally recognized certification in order to implement an E-PACS solution. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication mechanisms. Well-recognized, vendor-neutral, IT certifications, as well as environmental considerations training, add additional expertise to an E-PACS project.|
|Network Engineers| (Optional) May hold a [Certified System Engineer ICAM PACS (CSEIP) certification](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"} or other similar, federally recognized certification. Engineers may optionally complete PACS products' manufacturers' training (i.e., PACS APL products) related to the E-PACS implementation. Should be knowledgeable about Federal Government and agency-specific policies, standards, and guidance documents related to enterprise networks and an E-PACS/PACS implementation. |
| Technicians | Should complete PACS products' manufacturers' training (i.e., PACS APL products) related to the E-PACS solution implementation.| 
| Operators | Should complete tailored training in Federal Government policies and standards related to E-PACS/PACS. Completing E-PACS/PACS products' manufacturers' (i.e., PACS APL products) certification related to the E-PACS implementation is recommended.|

## Training Opportunities

{% include alert-info.html content="Agencies that plan to initiate an E-PACS Project should include line items for related employee training in their annual training plans and annual training budgets." %}

### Equipment Manufacturers
[GSA PACS APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"} PACS manufacturers whose products are listed on the GSA PACS APL offer product-specific courses for Operators and Technicians directly through the manufacturer or through authorized service providers. Operators and Technicians may obtain certifications for completing some series of courses.

>**Note:** Manufacturer training may not address unique operational requirements or site-specific configurations, so authorized service providers should conduct this training:  [GSA Schedule 84](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/list-of-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement){:target="_blank"}, and/or [GSA Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70){:target="_blank"}.
