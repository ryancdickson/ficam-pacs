This page provides a sample PACS/E-PACS Procurements Checklist. You can reuse or tailor this checklist according to your agency’s practices.

## PACS/E-PACS Procurement Checklist 
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**1. Identify agency's need to procure or upgrade a PACS/E-PACS**
- Determine whether your agency has a similar effort underway or other projects that could impact the procurement.
- Determine why the agency needs to procure or upgrade a PACS/E-PACS. 
- Perform a cost-benefit analysis. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**2. Develop a PACS/E-PACS project charter** 
- Identify the PACS/E-PACS project's executive sponsor.
- Document a high-level project purpose, scope, and goals. 
- Identify what standards and requirements need to be addressed (e.g., HSPD-12, FIPS 201-2, NIST SP 800-116, Revision 1).
- Estimate project duration.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**3. Identify and obtain support from PACS/E-PACS stakeholders (iterative)**
- Identify your required and optional stakeholders and request their participation.
- Include national, regional, state, and local stakeholders.
- Involve stakeholders from agency Information Technology (IT) teams (e.g., architect/engineers, network engineers, security, infrastructure services, directory services, web services).
- Involve agency facility and personnel support organizations (e.g., physical security, building operations, Human Resources). 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**4. Identify PACS/E-PACS project phases and tasks (iterative)**
- Document the project's phases and required tasks. Samples can include:
    -	Pre-project planning
    -	Site security assessment(s)
    -	Develop Statement of Work (SOW)
    -   Develop PACS/E-PACS Requirements Document (or Specification)
    -	Develop and release Request for Information (RFI) 
    -	Request for Proposal (RFP)/Request for Quotation (RFQ)  
    -	Integrator (vendor) evaluation and award
    -   Design
    -   Implementation
    -   Inspections
    -   Testing
    -	Close-out
    -	Sustainment

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**5. Develop a project schedule (iterative)**
- Use automated tools or agency software to create a project schedule (i.e., project tasks, dependencies, durations, and resources).
- Share the project schedule with stakeholders to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**6. Conduct a Facility Security Level (FSL) assessment of project-related agency sites and determine a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication mechanism for each site**
 - For details, see [Aligning FSL and Authentication Mechanism]({{site.baseurl}}/alignfslandauth/){:target="_blank"}.
 - The FSL assessment and chosen PIV authentication mechanisms will form the basis for the PACS/E-PACS requirements document/specification, as well as affect the SOW and project costs.
 - The sample survey questions below will help you assess the FSL of each facility and select the right PIV authentication mechanisms: <br>
    -	Who (i.e., include all possible users) will use a facility’s PACS/E-PACS?
    -	What credentials do the facility’s users and visitors have?
    -	What facility access risks exist? 
    -	How can the facility mitigate these risks? 
    -	What PACS/E-PACS installations does the facility need?
    -	What support systems would be integrated into the facility's PACS/E-PACS (e.g., intrusion detection, video surveillance, emergency notification, elevator control)?
    -	What PACS/E-PACS integrator or other contractor services does the agency need to solicit bids on?
    -	What PACS/E-PACS hardware and software is needed? 
	
 -  Your agency's selected integrator will help select the approved, needed hardware and software through the GSA Acquisitions process (Schedules 70 and 84, Blanket Purchase Orders, etc.). Useful considerations: <br>
    -	What are the facility's common ingress and egress traffic patterns? 
    -	What throughput speeds are needed?
    -	What are the ongoing operational and projected maintenance needs?
    -	What are the training needs for PACS/E-PACS administrators, operators, technicians, and users?
    -   Which PIV authentication mechanism(s) will be needed to secure the facility?


{% include alert-warning.html content="GSA Schedules changes are afoot! In November 2018, GSA announced that Multiple Award Schedules will soon incorporate all Schedules to streamline contracting for federal agencies. GSA Acquisitions, your procurement official, and chosen integrator can help you navigate the new MAS.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**7. Develop a PACS/E-PACS requirements document (or specification)**
- When documenting PACS/E-PACS requirements, it's critical to solicit input from your stakeholders.  
- Organize requirements into clear categories (e.g., technical, performance, and operational) to help stakeholder's give targeted feedback.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**8. Release a Request for Information (RFI) to potential service providers**
- Create and issue an RFI to vendors that requests specific qualifications and capabilities against PACS/E-PACS requirements.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**9. Submit an IT funding proposal following your agency's budgetary process**

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**10. Develop an RFP and SOW to solicit GSA-approved integrator bids**
 
-  You can reuse the [GSA PACS Customer Ordering Guide's Sample Statement of Work]( https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/General_Supplies__Services/Guide_to_PACS_v2%2006-12-2018.pdf){:target="_blank"}, page 17.

## Why Can We Buy Only GSA-Approved Products and Services?
[GSA’s FIPS 201 Evaluation Program](https://www.idmanagement.gov/fips201/){:target="_blank"} tests all GSA-listed PACS products, topologies, and services for compliance with FIPS 201-2 requirements. Purchasing products listed on the GSA APL ensures product compliance with FIPS 201-2, secure operations, and interoperability.
