This page provides a sample E-PACS Procurements Checklist. You can reuse or tailor this checklist according to your agency’s practices.

## E-PACS Procurement Checklist 
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**1. Identify agency's need to procure an E-PACS**
- Determine whether your agency has a similar effort underway or other projects that could impact the procurement.
- Determine why the agency needs to procure an E-PACS. 
- Perform a cost-benefit analysis. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**2. Develop an E-PACS project charter** 
- Identify the E-PACS procurement project's executive sponsor.
- Document a high-level project purpose, scope, and goals. 
- Identify what standards and requirements need to be addressed (e.g., HSPD-12, FIPS 201-2, NIST SP 800-116, Revision 1).
- Estimate project duration.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**3. Identify and obtain support from E-PACS stakeholders (iterative)**
- Identify your required and optional stakeholders and request their participation.
- Include national, regional, state, and local stakeholders.
- Involve stakeholders from agency Information Technology (IT) teams (e.g., architect/engineers, network engineers, security, infrastructure services, directory services, web services).
- Involve agency facility and personnel support organizations (e.g., physical security, building operations, Human Resources). 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**4. Identify E-PACS project phases and tasks (iterative)**
- Document the project's phases and required tasks:
    -	Pre-project planning
    -	Site security assessment(s)
    -	Develop Statement of Work (SOW)
    -   Develop E-PACS Requirements Document (or Specification)
    -	Develop and release Request for Information (RFI) 
    -	Request for Proposal (RFP)/Request for Quotation (RFQ)  
    -	Integrator (vendor) evaluation and award
    -   Design
    -   Implementation
    -   Inspections
    -   Testing
    -	Close-out
    -	Sustainment

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**5. Develop a project schedule (iterative)**
- Use automated tools or agency software to create a project schedule (i.e., project tasks, dependencies, durations, and resources).
- Share the project schedule with stakeholders to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**6. Conduct an Facility Security Level (FSL) assessment of project-related agency sites and determine a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication mechanism for each site**
 - For details, see [Aligning FSL and Authentication Mechanism]({{site.baseurl}}/alignfslandauth/){:target="_blank"}.
> **Note:** The FSL assessment and chosen PIV authentication mechanisms will form the basis for the E-PACS requirements document/specification, as well as affect the SOW and project costs.

>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;The sample survey questions will help you assess the FSL of each facility and select the right PIV authentication mechanisms:
-	Who (i.e., include all possible users) will use a facility’s E-PACS?
-	What credentials do the facility’s users and visitors have?
-	What facility access risks exist? 
-	How can the facility mitigate these risks? 
-	What E-PACS installations does the facility need?
-	What supporting systems would be integrated into the facility's EPACS (e.g., intrusion detection, video-surveillance, emergency notification, elevator control)?
-	What E-PACS integrator and other contractor services does the agency need to solicit bids on?
-	What E-PACS hardware and software is needed (i.e., procurements from the GSA PACS APL, GSA Multiple Awards Schedules [MAS], Schedules 70 and 84)? 
> **Note:** Your agency's selected integrator will help select the needed hardware and software through the GSA Acquisitions process (GSA PACS APL, MAS, Schedules 70 and 84, Blanket Purchase Orders, etc.).
-	What are the facility's common ingress and egress traffic patterns? 
-	What throughput speeds are needed?
-	What are the ongoing operational and projected maintenance needs?
-	What are the training needs for E-PACS administrators, operators, technicians, and users?
-   Which PIV authentication mechanism(s) will be needed to secure the facility?


{% include alert-warning.html content="GSA Schedules changes are afoot! In November 2018, GSA announced that Multiple Award Schedules will soon incorporate all Schedules to streamline contracting for federal agencies. GSA Acquisitions, your procurement official, and chosen integrator can help you navigate the new MAS. Read all about it <a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/schedules-news-and-updates\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>." %}



<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**7. Develop an E-PACS requirements document (or specification)**
- When documenting E-PACS requirements, it's critical to solicit input from your stakeholders.  
- Organize requirements into clear categories (e.g., technical, performance, and operational) to help stakeholder's give targeted feedback.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**8. Release a Request for Information (RFI) to potential service providers**
- Create and issue an RFI to vendors that requests detailed qualifications and capabilities against E-PACS requirements.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**9. Submit an IT funding proposal following your agency's budgetary process**

>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Federal Government funding sources may be available (e.g., [Technology Modernization Fund]( https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/technology-modernization-fund){:target="_blank"}).

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**10. Develop an RFP and SOW to solicit GSA-approved integrator bids**
 
>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;You can reuse the [GSA PACS Customer Ordering Guide's Sample Statement of Work]( https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/General_Supplies__Services/Guide_to_PACS_v2%2006-12-2018.pdf){:target="_blank"}, page 17.

For help with Requests for Quotations (RFQs), see [GSA's eBuy RFQ Online Tool](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/){:target="_blank"}.



<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**11. Solicit bids, evaluate, and award integrator contract**

>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;During your bid and evaluation process, include these steps:
- Identify members of the evaluation committee.
- Establish evaluation criteria for bid review. 
- Identify how well proposed integrator solutions meet your needs. 
- Document the award rationale and announce contract award decision. 
- Upon request, provide a brief explanation of the award rationale to unsuccessful bidder(s).

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**12. Develop an E-PACS architecture and migration strategy** 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**13. Buy products from the [GSA PACS APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"} through the [GSA MAS](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/schedules-news-and-updates){:target="_blank"}, [GSA Schedule 70]( https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70){:target="_blank"}, and [GSA Schedule 84](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/list-of-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement){:target="_blank"}**. 

> **Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;After contract award, your integrator will help you:
- Choose the best E-PACS topology (i.e., an end-to-end solution of hardware, software, a Certificate Validation System, and PIV card readers) from the [GSA PACS APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"} for the PIV authentication mechanisms selected for your facility.  
- Buy the products and additional services you need by using the GSA resources in Checklist item 13 above. Your chosen integrator will help your agency choose the right E-PACS products and services, according to your agency's preferred GSA purchasing vehicle(s).
