## **CHANGE TITLE OF PLAYBOOK TO "ENTERPRISE PACS PLAYBOOK"??

**Rough Ideas for this section** **<Please review Questions and Issues>** 

## USE CASES??**
* A Federal Government agency that wants to purchase an Enterprise PACS (E-PACS).
* An agency component that wants to tie its site(s) into the agency's E-PACS by replacing the current, site-specific PACS hardware and software to conform to the agency's E-PACS requirements.
* An agency component whose sites have site-specific PACS but do not have the budget for wholesale replacement of hardware and software. These site(s) want a solution where they can continue to use their current PACS but still benefit from some or all of the agency's E-PACS capabilities, until these sites receive funding for hardware and software replacement to conform completely to the E-PACS requirements.
* An agency component that wants to buy a first-time, site-specific PACS that will not be tied into the agency's E-PACS due to remote location or other precluding justifications.
* An agency component that wants to upgrade some of its site-specific PACS hardware and software to conform to the agency's E-PACS requirements, but due to budget must do this incrementally via a multi-year conversion plan.

## INTENDED AUDIENCES (Federal Government Agencies)?**
* *Do we need to break down Procurement Roles?*
- IT Project Managers who oversee agency component or site IT projects (Does this role also oversee development of RFP, SOW, Requirements Document/Specification used to solicit Integrator bids?)
- IT PACS Leads who oversee agency component or site PACS implementation or upgrade...?  (Or would this be another title? Does this role oversee PACS projects at multiple agency components or sites?) 
- IT Project Procurement Officers and Leads who oversee procurements for agency component's or a site's IT projects. (Does this role work with the IT Project Manager to develop RFP, SOW, Requirements Document/Specification used to solicit Integrator bids?)  Someone who works for the agency's Office of Procurement (NASA's title) or Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (DHS' title)...?
- IT PACS Implementation/Upgrade Team (government) for agency component or site
- Physical Security Managers for agency (what title?) (Any difference between Physical Security Manager for personnel vs. IT?)
- Physical Security Managers for component or site (Any difference between Physical Security Manager for personnel vs. IT?)


**LINK SPECIFIC ROLES TO SPECIFIC SECTIONS?? - e.g., PROCUREMENT OFFICIALS LINK TO PROCUREMENTS SECTION??**

**QUESTIONS ABOUT PLAYBOOK PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE.**<br>
**WHO CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS? -- Set LaChelle Meeting?**<br>
**What is the Playbook Purpose?**<br>
**Who is the Audience? Agencies (top-level) or Agency Sites or Both?** <br>
**What is the SUBJECT?** <br>
- How to buy and implement a PACS for Sites? 
- AND How to buy and implement an E-PACS for Agencies? 
- AND How to unify existing site PACS with an agency's E-PACS?  
- **We call this the "PACS Playbook" but the major section about PACS is called **ENTERPRISE PACS"..?? We don't have a section about "Site-Specific PACS," so this Playbook wouldn't apply to an agency component/site that wanted to buy only a site-specific PACS and for budgetary or location reasons doesn't ever plan to tie into the agency's E-PACS.**
- How many Agencies have an E-PACS? Are we talking to the Agency (Headquarters/Senior Level?) or to their Components / Sites?  Some Sites are connected to it; some are not? What percentage of sites are/are not part of the E-PACS system?   
- How many Agencies don't have an E-PACS? Are we talking to them? 
- Is our purpose to tell those agencies how to buy an E-PACS and implement it at Agency Headquarters? Components? All of its sites? Some of its sites?? 
- The Schedule 84 "PACS Customer Ordering Guide" implies that an agency could buy an E-PACS that would be used for a *group of sites* (not necessarily *all agency sites*). What is this about and how does this work? 
- We are saying herein that some agency sites have a site-specific PACS and some are tied into the agency's E-PACS?  
- We are saying herein that if a site wanted to "join" the agency E-PACS (running on the agency's enterprise network) but retain its current PACS (i.e., unify its PACS with the E-PACS) (i.e., could be due to budget or...?), they could use the guidance in the "E-PACS" section for *unifying*. (No mention of how an agency would buy or implement a first-time E-PACS and whether the agency might mandate that its components/sites link up with it by any specified means.)

**<Is this the purpose?>**
This guide will help federal agency IT Project Managers, IT Architects/Managers, PACS Project Leads, IT Departments, Network Engineers, and Procurement Officials and Leads to understand:
* What is an Enterprise Physical Access Control System (E-PACS) so they can buy and implement it for an Agency (Headquarters) and other Sites?
* How Sites can unify their existing site-specific PACS with an agency E-PACS?  
* How to determine what a site's Facility Security Level (FSL) is for a first-time site-specific PACS? ...or for a first-time agency E-PACS purchase (e.g, at Headquarters)?
* How to decide what PIV-credential authentication mechanism is best for securing high-value and other critical assets at one site for site-specific PACS? Not related to agency E-PACS?
* How to procure service provider support (Integrator and other services) for a first-time agency E-PACS or site-specific PACS? Or upgrades so components or sites can tie into the agency's E-PACS?  
* PACS IT upgrades and configuration changes when procuring an agency's first-time E-PACS?
* What are the advantages of connecting your site-specific PACS to the agency's existing E-PACS?

*What is an EPACS?* 

An Enterprise PACS is connected to an agency's network, from which IT and Security personnel can manage many sites' PACS. For any site-specific PACS, employees, contractors, and visitors gain authorized access to a site (and assets) by using a PIV credential and access authorizations (i.e., privileges).

*How is an EPACS different from a PACS?*

In the simplest terms, a PACS is *site-specific* and an E-PACS is *agency-wide* (or *enterprise-wide*).

*Our agency site already has a PACS, but it isn't connected to the agency's new E-PACS. How could our PACS be included in the agency's E-PACS and what are the advantages?*

An agency's E-PACS will:

* Provide a unified agency view of all identities (and privileges) when an employee, contractor, or visitor presents a PIV credential for physical access to an agency site
* Reduce agency's overall costs and site costs, especially for enterprise licenses and renewals
* ...
* ...

*How can my agency learn more about the federal acquisitions processes for procuring an E-PACS?*

Moving from a PACS to an EPACS takes time, planning, procurements processes, and resources.  GSA Acquisitions offers many options to assist you with ...

*If our agency buys an E-PACS, how long will it take to implement it at Headquarters?  We have X number of sites. How long will it take for us to roll out upgrade hardware and software to our sites?*

E-PACS implementations are unique to each agency.... (more) *Any way to quantify an answer to above question or give them guidance?* 

*I understand that OMB Circular A-130 states that PACS are now considered IT systems. What does this mean to my agency?*

It means that an E-PACS falls under federal reporting requirements ...FISMA, etc.  

*Are there lessons learned from other agencies?*

Yes, please see [Lessons Learned]({{.....baseurl}}pacs_lessons_learned.md)<!--What's the syntax?-->
.
.


*It seems like there could be a lot of moving parts to buying an E-PACS. What is the straightest path to procuring and implementing an E-PACS?  How do we convert our sites' PACS to network with the E-PACS?*

* How do we plan for an E-PACS project?  What is the process?<!--modified process chart?  goes where?-->
* How do we determine facility risk? **<What Audience is FSL information for? What purpose?>**
* <**E-PACS or PACS-related?>** How do we decide what PIV authentication method is needed if our agency has different facilities and even floors in another agency's facility?
* How much will this cost?
* How do we solicit bids for an E-PACS?  PACS conversions to network with E-PACS?
* Where do we find GSA-approved contractors?
* Where do we procure GSA-approved hardware and software?
* How do we get training for our federal employees?
* What regulations, policies, and standards apply?

This guide will help you sort it all out.
