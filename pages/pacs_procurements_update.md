This page provides sample PACS/E-PACS Procurements Checklists for a variety of roles within your agency: 

- [Security Engineers](#security-engineers)
- [Project Managers](#project-managers)
- [Acquisition Officers](#acquisition-officers)
- [Chief Information Officers](#chief-information-officers)
- [Chief Security Officers](#chief-security-officers)

You can reuse or tailor these checklists according to your agency’s practices.

## Security Engineers

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct a Facility Security Level (FSL) assessment of project-related agency sites and determine a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication mechanism for each site**
 - For details, see [Aligning FSL and Authentication Mechanism]({{site.baseurl}}/alignfslandauth/){:target="_blank"}.
 - The FSL assessment and chosen PIV authentication mechanisms will form the basis for the PACS/E-PACS requirements document/specification, as well as affect the SOW and project costs.
 - The sample survey questions below will help you assess the FSL of each facility and select the right PIV authentication mechanisms: <br>
    -	Who (i.e., include all possible users) will use a facility’s PACS/E-PACS?
    -	What credentials do the facility’s users and visitors have?
    -	What facility access risks exist? 
    -	How can the facility mitigate these risks? 
    -	What PACS/E-PACS installations does the facility need?
    -	What supporting systems would be integrated into the facility's PACS/E-PACS (e.g., intrusion detection, video-surveillance, emergency notification, elevator control)?
    -	What PACS/E-PACS integrator and other contractor services does the agency need to solicit bids on?
    -	What PACS/E-PACS hardware and software is needed? 
	
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a PACS/E-PACS requirements document (or specification)**
- When documenting PACS/E-PACS requirements, it's critical to solicit input from your stakeholders.  
- Organize requirements into clear categories (e.g., technical, performance, and operational) to help stakeholder's give targeted feedback.


<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a PACS/E-PACS architecture and migration strategy** 
- Define a migration strategy to transition facilities to the new PACS solution.

## Project Managers

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a PACS/E-PACS project charter** 
- Identify the PACS/E-PACS project's executive sponsor.
- Document a high-level project purpose, scope, and goals. 
- Identify what standards and requirements need to be addressed (e.g., HSPD-12, FIPS 201-2, NIST SP 800-116, Revision 1).
- Estimate project duration.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify and obtain support from PACS/E-PACS stakeholders (iterative)**
- Identify your required and optional stakeholders and request their participation.
- Include national, regional, state, and local stakeholders.
- Involve stakeholders from agency Information Technology (IT) teams (e.g., architect/engineers, network engineers, security, infrastructure services, directory services, web services).
- Involve agency facility and personnel support organizations (e.g., physical security, building operations, Human Resources). 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify PACS/E-PACS project phases and tasks (iterative)**
- Document the project's phases and required tasks. Samples can include:
    -	Pre-project planning
    -	Site security assessment(s)
    -	Develop Statement of Work (SOW)
    -   Develop PACS/E-PACS Requirements Document (or Specification)
    -	Develop and release Request for Information (RFI) 
    -	Request for Proposal (RFP)/Request for Quotation (RFQ)  
    -	Integrator (vendor) evaluation and award
    -   Design
    -   Implementation
    -   Inspections
    -   Testing
    -	Close-out
    -	Sustainment

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Submit an IT funding proposal following your agency's budgetary process**

	
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop a project schedule (iterative)**
- Use automated tools or agency software to create a project schedule (i.e., project tasks, dependencies, durations, and resources).
- Share the project schedule with stakeholders to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

## Acquisition Officers

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Document agency's need to procure a PACS/E-PACS**
- Determine whether your agency has a similar effort underway or other projects that could impact the procurement.
- Determine why the agency needs to procure a PACS/E-PACS. 
- Perform a cost-benefit analysis. 


<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Release a Request for Information (RFI) to potential service providers**
