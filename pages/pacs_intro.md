This _Physical Access Control System (PACS) Guide_ will help IT architects, engineers, and project managers understand concepts related to _Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management_-compliant PACS or Enterprise Physical Access Control Systems (E-PACS). 

In the simplest terms, a PACS is a *standalone* system that controls physical access at one federal agency site by authenticating employees and contractors. An E-PACS extends the concept of a PACS to instead act as a unified,  *enterprise-wide* system that controls physical access at most (or all) sites that belong to an agency.
