This _Physical Access Control System (PACS) Guide_ will help IT architects, engineers, and project managers who implement PACS or Enterprise Physical Access Control Systems (E-PACS) for their agencies to understand Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)-compliant PACS and E-PACS concepts. 

In the simplest terms, a PACS is a *standalone* system that controls physical access at one federal agency site by authenticating employees and contractors. An E-PACS is an *enterprise-wide* system that controls physical access at most (or all) sites that belong to an agency. An E-PACS enforces authentication by using the same methods as used by a standalone PACS.
